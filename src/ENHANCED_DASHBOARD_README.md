## 💡 Smart Features Explained

### 1. **Auto-Detection**
**How it works**:
- System checks every EMI and recurring expense
- Compares against current month's expenses
- If not found → Shows as pending
- Prevents duplicates automatically

**Example**:
- You have "Car EMI - ₹15,000" set up
- On Oct 1, system checks expenses
- No matching expense found for October
- Alert shows: "1 EMI pending - ₹15,000"
- You click "Add All"
- Expense created: "Car EMI - EMI Payment - ₹15,000 - Oct 1"
- Alert disappears

---

### 2. **Duplicate Prevention**
**Smart matching**:
- Checks description similarity
- Verifies amount (exact match within ₹0.01)
- Confirms same month/year
- Skips if already exists

**Result**: Never add the same expense twice!

---

### 3. **Financial Health Scoring**
**Calculation**:

Base: **100 points**

**Deductions**:
- Spending over 100% of income: **-30 points**
- Spending 80-100% of income: **-15 points**
- Obligations over 60% of income: **-25 points**
- Obligations 40-60% of income: **-15 points**

**Bonuses**:
- Savings progress over 80%: **+10 points**
- Savings progress 50-80%: **+5 points**

**Example**:
```
Base: 100
Spending at 75%: -0 (under 80%)
Obligations at 57%: -15 (40-60% range)
Savings at 75%: +5 (50-80% range)
Final Score: 90 → Excellent! 🌟
```
