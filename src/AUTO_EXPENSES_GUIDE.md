## 🔄 Auto-Calculation Logic

### How It Works

#### 1. **EMI Auto-Calculation**
```
For each EMI:
  ✓ Check if EMI is currently active (within start/end dates)
  ✓ Check if EMI already added this month
  ✓ If not added → Show as pending
  ✓ Calculate total pending amount
```

#### 2. **Recurring Expense Auto-Calculation**
```
For each recurring expense:
  ✓ Check if expense is active (not paused)
  ✓ Check if expense already added this month
  ✓ If not added → Show as pending
  ✓ Calculate total pending amount
```

#### 3. **Duplicate Prevention**
The system checks:
- Same description
- Same amount (within ₹0.01)
- Same month and year
- If all match → Already added, skip
