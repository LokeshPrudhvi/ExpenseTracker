# Expense Tracker - Product Overview

## Philosophy

This expense tracker is built on sound financial principles to help users:
- **Avoid overspending** by tracking expenses against income (not arbitrary budgets)
- **Build financial health** through savings and smart spending habits
- **Prevent debt** by warning when spending exceeds income
- **Achieve goals** through dedicated savings tracking

## Core Features

### 1. Income-Based Tracking (No Separate Budget)
- Users set their monthly income
- All expenses are tracked as a percentage of income
- **No separate budget to manage** - simplifies the mental model
- Clear visibility into "how much have I spent vs. how much do I earn"

### 2. Financial Health Score (0-100)
A data-driven score that considers:
- **Spending rate** (penalty if > 80% of income)
- **Savings rate** (penalty if < 20% of income)
- **Overspending** (major penalty if spending > income)
- **Goal setting** (bonus for having savings goals)

**Status Levels:**
- 80-100: Excellent (green)
- 60-79: Good (blue)
- 40-59: Fair (yellow)
- 0-39: Needs Attention (red)

### 3. The 50/30/20 Rule
Based on the widely-recommended budgeting framework:
- **50% Needs**: Essential expenses (rent, utilities, food, healthcare, transportation)
- **30% Wants**: Lifestyle expenses (entertainment, shopping, dining out)
- **20% Savings**: Emergency fund, goals, investments

The app automatically categorizes expenses and shows:
- How much you're spending in each category
- Whether you're within recommended limits
- Visual progress bars for each category

### 4. Personalized Financial Insights
